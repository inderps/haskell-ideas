# haskell-ideas
Basic ideas which can be taken from Haskell to implement in other languages


## Type Signatures

```haskell

x :: Int
x = 3

f :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
f x y z = x + y + z

```


## Guards

```haskell

hailstone :: Integer -> Integer
hailstone n
  | n `mod` 2 == 0 = n `div` 2
  | otherwise      = 3*n + 1

isEven :: Integer -> Bool
isEven n 
  | n `mod` 2 == 0 = True
  | otherwise      = False

```


## Enumeration types

```haskell

data Thing = Shoe 
           | Ship 
           | SealingWax 
           | Cabbage 

data FailableDouble = Failure
                    | OK Double
                    
ex01 = Failure
ex02 = OK 3.4

data Person = Person String Int Thing
        

```


## Pattern-matching

```haskell

intListLength :: [Integer] -> Integer
intListLength []     = 0
intListLength (x:xs) = 1 + intListLength xs

isSmall :: Thing -> Bool
isSmall Ship = False
isSmall King = False
isSmall _    = True

baz :: Person -> String
baz p@(Person n _ _) = "The name field of (" ++ show p ++ ") is " ++ n

```


## Function composition & Currying

```haskell

myTest' :: [Integer] -> Bool
myTest' = even . length . greaterThan100

f :: Int -> Int -> Int
f x y = 2*x + y

```




## Others

```haskell

-- Case expressions
ex03 = case "Hello" of
           []      -> 3
           ('H':s) -> length s
           _       -> 7


-- Polymorphism
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a


-- Anonymous functions
greaterThan100_2 :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
greaterThan100_2 xs = filter (\x -> x > 100) xs

greaterThan100_3 :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
greaterThan100_3 xs = filter (>100) xs


```
